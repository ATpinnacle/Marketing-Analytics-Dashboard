# Marketing Analytics Dashboard

This repository contains a project focused on creating a **Marketing Analytics Dashboard** to analyze customer engagement, conversion rates, and feedback for optimizing marketing strategies. 

## Overview

### Business Problem
An online retail business, faced the following challenges:

- **Decreased Conversion Rates**: Fewer visitors converting into paying customers.
- **High Marketing Expenses**: Increased investment in campaigns not yielding expected returns.
- **Customer Feedback Analysis Needed**: Limited understanding of customer needs and opinions.

The objective was to conduct a detailed analysis and provide actionable insights to address these challenges.

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- **Conversion Rate**: Percentage of website visitors who make a purchase.
- **Customer Engagement Rate**: Interaction levels with marketing content (e.g., clicks, likes, comments).
- **Average Order Value (AOV)**: Average amount spent per transaction.
- **Customer Feedback Score**: Sentiment derived from customer reviews.

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Transformation and Cleaning**
   - Utilized **SQL** to clean and transform data from multiple sources, ensuring consistency and reducing preprocessing time by 40%.

2. **Sentiment Analysis**
   - Conducted sentiment analysis on customer reviews and social media comments using **Python** libraries such as:
     - **nltk** for text preprocessing and sentiment scoring.
     - **pyodbc** for database connectivity.
