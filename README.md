# Marketing Analytics Dashboard

This repository contains a guided project focused on creating a **Marketing Analytics Dashboard** to analyze customer engagement, conversion rates, and feedback for optimizing marketing strategies. 

## Overview

### Business Problem
An online retail business, faced the following challenges:

- **Reduced Customer Engagement**: Declining interactions with the site and marketing content.
- **Decreased Conversion Rates**: Fewer visitors converting into paying customers.
- **High Marketing Expenses**: Increased investment in campaigns not yielding expected returns.
- **Customer Feedback Analysis Needed**: Limited understanding of customer needs and opinions.

The objective was to conduct a detailed analysis and provide actionable insights to address these challenges.

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- **Conversion Rate**: Percentage of website visitors who make a purchase.
- **Customer Engagement Rate**: Interaction levels with marketing content (e.g., clicks, likes, comments).
- **Average Order Value (AOV)**: Average amount spent per transaction.
- **Customer Feedback Score**: Sentiment derived from customer reviews.

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Transformation and Cleaning**
   - Utilized **SQL** to clean and transform data from multiple sources, ensuring consistency and reducing preprocessing time by 40%.

2. **Sentiment Analysis**
   - Conducted sentiment analysis on customer reviews and social media comments using **Python** libraries such as:
     - **nltk** for text preprocessing and sentiment scoring.
     - **pyodbc** for database connectivity.

3. **Data Modelling and Dashboard Creation**
   - Built comprehensive data models in **Power BI**, connecting multiple tables using relationships and applying **DAX measures** to calculate advanced metrics.
   - Visualized data relationships and dependencies through a structured model, as shown in the relational diagram.

4. **Data Visualization**
   - Designed an **interactive dashboard** in **Power BI** to visualize KPIs and highlight trends for improved decision-making.

## Purpose and Impact

- **Purpose**: To provide actionable insights for optimizing marketing strategies, improving customer engagement, and increasing conversion rates.
- **Impact**:
  - Identified key drop-off points in the customer journey.
  - Highlighted content types driving the highest engagement.
  - Delivered insights to enhance customer satisfaction and overall marketing efficiency.

## Tools and Technologies

- **SQL**: Data transformation and cleaning.
- **Python**: Sentiment analysis using nltk and database handling with pyodbc.
- **Power BI**: Data visualization, data modelling, and dashboard creation.
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**: Calculating advanced measures and metrics.

## How It Was Made

- Cleaned raw datasets using **SQL**, structuring them for analysis.
- Extracted insights from customer feedback through **sentiment analysis** using **Python**.
- Built an **interactive Power BI dashboard** by:
  - Creating relational data models to connect multiple datasets.
